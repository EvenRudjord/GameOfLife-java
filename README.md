# Game of Life - Java

## Description

This is a Java implementation of **Conway's Game of Life**, a cellular automaton created by mathematician John Conway.

## Rules

1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies (underpopulation).
2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies (overpopulation).
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell (reproduction).

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository.
2. Compile the Java files with `javac *.java`.
3. Run the program with `java Main`.
